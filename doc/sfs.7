.IX Title "SFS 7"
.TH SFS 7 "2004-01-07" "perl v5.8.4" "SFS 0.8pre"
.SH "NAME"
SFS \- Self Certifying Filesystem
.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
.IX Header "DOCUMENTATION"
This manpage was written as short description and as pointer to more
complete documentation. Up to date documentation can be found as
Info-pages of \s-1SFS\s0.  You can access the Info pages with command \*(L"info
sfs\*(R".  An \s-1HTML\s0 version of the info pages may also be available on your
system in /usr/local/lib/sfs/sfs.html or /usr/lib/sfs/sfs.html.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1SFS\s0 is a secure, global network filesystem with completedly
decentralized control. It takes \s-1NFS\s0 shares exported from localhost and
transports them securely to other hosts; \s-1NFS\s0 services do not need to
be exposed to network.
.PP
\&\s-1SFS\s0 features key management and authorization separated from 
filesystem with key revokation separated from key distribution.
.PP
More information and new versions can be found on the \s-1SFS\s0 website:
.PP
http://www.fs.net/
.SH "GLOBAL NAMESPACE"
.IX Header "GLOBAL NAMESPACE"
\&\s-1SFS\s0 mounts directories from fileservers under a directory in the
form:
.PP
/sfs/@\fBLocation\fR,\fIHostID\fR
.PP
\&\fBLocation\fR is either ip address or \s-1DNS\s0 hostname of the server.
.PP
\&\fIHostID\fR is a collision-resistant cryptographic hash of 
the file server's public key.
.SH "CLIENT DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "CLIENT DESCRIPTION"
Client side operation of \s-1SFS\s0 consists of following programs:
.IP "\fBsfscd\fR" 2
.IX Item "sfscd"
creates and serves /sfs directory on client machine. Also
starts nfsmounter and sfsrwcd as needed. 
.IP "\fBnfsmounter\fR" 2
.IX Item "nfsmounter"
mounts and unmounts \s-1NFS\s0 filesystems as kernel \s-1NFS\s0 client accesses them.
.IP "\fBsfsrwcd\fR" 2
.IX Item "sfsrwcd"
is a daemon that implements normal read/write filesystem protocol.
It acts as a \s-1NFS\s0 server to local \s-1NFS\s0 client.
.SH "USER PROGRAMS"
.IX Header "USER PROGRAMS"
On client machine user normally uses the following prog\-
rams:
.IP "\fBsfsagent\fR" 2
.IX Item "sfsagent"
handles authentication as user moves to new filesystems.
It also can fetch new HostIDs and perform revocation checks on them.
.IP "\fBsfskey\fR" 2
.IX Item "sfskey"
manages user and server keys and is used to configure sfsagent for
different situations.
.IP "\fBrex\fR" 2
.IX Item "rex"
a remote login program, similar in spirit to \s-1SSH\s0, that uses \s-1SFS\s0's key
management and authentication mechanisms, and can forward a user's
sfsagent to remote machines.
.SH "SERVER DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "SERVER DESCRIPTION"
Server side consists of following programs:
.IP "\fBsfssd\fR" 2
.IX Item "sfssd"
handles incoming connections and spawns sfsrwcd and sfsrwcd as needed.
.IP "\fBsfsrwcd\fR" 2
.IX Item "sfsrwcd"
is a daemon that implements normal read/write filesystem protocol and 
talks to local \s-1NFS\s0 server.
.IP "\fBsfsauthd\fR" 2
.IX Item "sfsauthd"
handles user authentication. It communicates directly with sfsrwsd 
to authenticate users of the file system. It also accepts connections 
over the network from sfskey to let users download their private keys 
or change their public keys.
.IP "\fBrexd\fR" 2
.IX Item "rexd"
remote login server that performs key exchange with remote rex clients
and does authorization checking of remote users before allowing them
to spawn or connect to \fBproxy\fR.
.IP "\fBproxy\fR" 2
.IX Item "proxy"
server-side of the rex remote login utility, which clients spawn and
connect to through the privileged \fBrexd\fR server.  There is typically
one instance of \fBproxy\fR per user logged into a machine (regardless of
how many times the user is logged in), running with the permissions of
the user.
.SH "HELPER BINARIES"
.IX Header "HELPER BINARIES"
.RS 2
There are few small programs to help with misc tasks:
.RE
.IP "\fBssu\fR" 2
.IX Item "ssu"
allows an unprivileged user to become root on the local machine
without changing his \s-1SFS\s0 credentials.
.IP "\fBrpcc\fR" 2
.IX Item "rpcc"
an \s-1RPC\s0 compiler for RFC1832\-format \s-1XDR\s0 files.  Used by other systems
that link against the \s-1SFS\s0 libraries.
.IP "\fBfunmount\fR" 2
.IX Item "funmount"
forcibly unmounts a file system, doing as little else as possible.
May be of use when cleaning up a system after a crash.
.IP "\fBdirsearch\fR" 2
.IX Item "dirsearch"
can be used with \fBsfskey certprog\fR command to configure certification
paths\*(--lists of directories in which to look for symbolic links to
\&\fIHostID\fRs.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"
\&\fIsfskey\fR\|(1), \fInfs\fR\|(5), \fIinfo\fR\|(1),
\&\fIsfsagent\fR\|(1)
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
Solid NFSv3 support is required from kernel and supporting utilities.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
You really do not want to kill \-9 nfsmounter, as it is responsible for
cleaning up and unmounting filesystems on the client side, if sfscd
has died or something else happened.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.IX Header "AUTHOR"
\&\s-1SFS\s0 was written by the \s-1SFS\s0 development team,
sfsdev@redlab.lcs.mit.edu.  This manpage was originally written by
Jaakko Niemi for sfs packaging in Debian/GNU Operating System.  It has
since been edited by the \s-1SFS\s0 development team and included with the
\&\s-1SFS\s0 distribution.
