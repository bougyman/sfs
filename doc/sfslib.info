1 Setting up a build directory using the SFS libraries
******************************************************

SFS's build process makes use of the GNU autoconf, automake, and
libtool packages.  Autoconf in particular is what creates the familiar
`./configure' script.  It is highly recommended that you use these
tools to set up the build directory for your project if you are
building against the SFS libraries.

   If you set up your project directory properly, your software will by
default search for and link against an installed version of SFS, but
can also be configured via the `--with-sfs=DIR' flag to link against an
uninstalled SFS build tree.  The latter is quite useful for debugging,
as one can use an unoptimized SFS build that was compiled with dmalloc.

   To set up a new project directory, you must perform the following
steps:

  1. Create a new directory for your project, say `yourproject'

  2. Copy the files `acinclude.m4' and `setup' from an SFS source
     distribution into your `yourproject/' directory.

  3. Create a `configure.in' file in `yourproject/', including some
     SFS-specific boilerplate and any extra tests you need to perform
     to determine properties of the compiler and operating system.
     *Note Minimal configure.in::, for more information on doing this.

  4. Create a `Makefile.am' file in `yourproject/', specifying what
     programs to build from what source files, and where to install
     them.  *Note Simple Makefile.am::, for more information on doing
     this.

  5. Create files `.cvsignore', `AUTHORS', `NEWS', `README', by running
     the following commands in `yourproject/':
          touch AUTHORS NEWS README
          cat <<EOF > .cvsignore
          .deps
          .libs
          Makefile
          Makefile.in
          aclocal.m4
          config.cache
          config.guess
          config.h
          config.h.in
          config.log
          config.status
          config.sub
          configure
          install-sh
          libtool
          ltconfig
          ltmain.sh
          missing
          mkinstalldirs
          stamp-h
          stamp-h.in
          EOF

  6. Now you are ready to build your software, which you can do by
     running the following commands in `yourproject/':
          sh ./setup
          ./configure --with-sfs=SFS-BUILD-DIRECTORY
          gmake

1.1 Software requirements for using autoconf/automake
=====================================================

In order to use `autoconf' and `automake', you will need the following
software packages installed on your machine.  (Many operations systems
have an easy way of installing software packages, so you might check
your local operating system's packaging system before installing these
from scratch.)

*dmalloc*
     `dmalloc' is a debugging malloc library, available from
     `http://dmalloc.com/'.  When developing software with the SFS
     libraries, you should link against dmalloc, as this also enables a
     number of debugging features in SFS.  If you do not develop with
     dmalloc, you will severely, severely regret it, unless you are a
     far better programmer than the SFS developers.  Far easier to
     discover bugs as you create them, with dmalloc, than to go back
     later and try to find what is causing improper behavior in
     thousands of lines of code you have already written....

*GNU m4*
     This is the macro processor used by `autoconf', available from
     `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/m4'.  Non-GNU versions of `m4' often do
     not work with `autoconf'.

*autoconf*
     Processes `configure.in' to produce the `configure' script,
     available from `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf'.

*automake*
     Processes `Makefile.am' files to produce the `Makefile.in' files
     that `configure' in turn uses to create `Makefile' files.
     Available from `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/automake'.

*libtool*
     Used by `automake'-generated `Makefile's to use and create
     libraries.  Available from `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libtool'.

     dnl By default LDEPS is set to all the static libraries you need to
     dnl link against.  If the SFS libraries are static, the default will
     dnl be:
     dnl
     dnl LDEPS = $(LIBSFSMISC) $(LIBSVC) $(LIBSFSCRYPT) \
     dnl         $(LIBARPC) $(LIBASYNC)
     dnl
     dnl You don't need to do anything, but if you are linking against a
     dnl subset of the SFS libraries, or want to add your own dependencies,
     dnl you can override the default value of LDEPS.  (This is for
     dnl dependency purposes only, it doesn't change the actual libraries
     dnl your programs are linked against.  See LDADD for that.)
     dnl
     dnl In any event, programs should be made dependent on LDEPS:
     dnl
     $(PROGRAMS): $(LDEPS)

     dnl Now define the programs you want to build.  Use noinst_PROGRAMS
     dnl for programs that do not get installed, bin_PROGRAMS for programs
     dnl that get installed in /usr/local/bin, sbin_PROGRAMS for ../sbin,
     dnl etc.
     dnl
     noinst_PROGRAMS = yourprogram

     dnl For each program, list the source files it includes
     dnl

     dnl If you want to change what all programs link against by default in
     dnl this directory, you can set LDADD (either here or in
     dnl configure.in).  The default is:
     dnl
     dnl LDADD = $(LIBSFSMISC) $(LIBSVC) $(LIBSFSCRYPT) \
     dnl         $(LIBARPC) $(LIBASYNC) $(LIBGMP)

     dnl If you want to change just what yourprogram links against, for
     dnl instance to and library yourlib.la in addition to the libasync
     dnl libraries, you can set the following variable:
     dnl
     dnl yourprogram_LDADD = yourlib.la $(LDADD)


     dnl Have to list all headers here, if you want them included with in
     dnl output of the "make distcheck" command.  If you want some headers
     dnl installed in /usr/local/include, put them in a variable named
     dnl include_HEADERS instead of noinst_HEADERS.
